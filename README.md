WoW One-Hand Accessibility Addon
Designed for Patch 11.2.7 "The Warning." This addon provides a Spec-Aware secure button that combines native Single-Button Assistant (SBA) logic with custom priority macros for S-Tier specs like BM Hunter and Havoc DH.
Features
Hold-to-Cast: Automatically enables the Patch 11.2.7 "Press and Hold" feature for the rotation button.
Spec Awareness: The button automatically switches logic when you change your specialization.
SBA Fallback: Uses Blizzard's rotation engine as a fallback for unsupported specs.
Usage
Type /onehand to unlock the button and move it to a comfortable position.
Bind the button to your preferred key (e.g., Button 1 on an MMO mouse) and hold it down in combat.
